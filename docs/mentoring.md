I offer my services as a mentor.  I have 25 years of tech industry experience
that is both broad and deep.  Two areas in particular that I think might have
appeal are:

**Career Growth**
:  I've worked in small and large companies in various
   engineering roles, both as an individual contributor and as a manager, and
   most recently was a Principal Engineer at a FAANG. I've started successful
   projects and grown teams around them, and mentored engineers of all levels,
   from New Grads to Staff Engineers to help them grow. I can share what has
   worked for me and how I look at things.

**Systems Software Engineering**
:  Ranging from high level distributed systems
   architecture down to nitty gritty details at the firmware level. Want to
   figure out how to make something work in Rust or C/C++, or on multiple
   operating systems? Do you have a thorny problem that you'd like to Pair
   Program on? Want a code review?

I'm happy to cover anything that I know, and not just what is shown above.

Ideally we'd meet across several regularly scheduled sessions, especially if
you are interested in growth, but individual ad-hoc sessions are also OK.

## How it works

I usually use [Discord](https://discord.com) to facilitate a video call.
Sessions are 1 hour in duration and are typically held on a monthly cadence.

In terms of the format, for career growth oriented engagements, I expect that
our first session will be a mixture of you telling me about yourself and your
goals, and me making suggestions or sharing anecdotes that may help you
navigate.  In future sessions I anticipate that we'll have a mixture of
checking in on how you're doing and you raising targeted/topical questions.

I want to be clear up-front that I don't claim to have all (or honestly, any!)
of the right answers for a given situation, but I can share how I might
approach it; what sorts of questions I might be asking myself internally and
the kind of calculus that I might apply.

For ad-hoc sessions where you'd like to dive into a technical problem,
what typically works is that you share your screen and we talk through
it.
