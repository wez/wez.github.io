# Projects

Here are a selection of Open Source projects that I've been involved
with.

[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)
:     A powerful cross-platform terminal emulator.

[KumoMTA](https://kumomta.com)
:     A high-performance MTA for sending email at scale.

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
:     A filesystem monitoring and querying service that can reason
      about changes over time in `O(1)`.

[EdenFS](https://github.com/facebook/sapling/tree/main/eden/fs)
:     A source-control aware FUSE filesystem for very large monorepos
      that present a lazy-loaded virtual view of the repo in your checkout.

[PHP](https://php.net)
:     A scripting language that powers a significant proportion of the web.
