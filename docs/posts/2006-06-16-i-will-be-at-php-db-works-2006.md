<p>I'll be giving my usual PDO talk, and a brand new, never-been-seen-before, talk: &quot;PHP and Mail: Best Practices&quot;.  This will be focused on good, responsible techniques for PHP applications that send out email, from accountability and performance viewpoints.   </p>
<p><a href="http://hades.phparch.com/ceres/public/page/index.php/works::schedule">You can find the schedule online here</a>; as usual, a lot of experienced folks (including several of my colleagues from OmniTI) are giving talks, and this year there are some damned good prizes to be won at the social events.   </p>
<p>See you there?  </p>
