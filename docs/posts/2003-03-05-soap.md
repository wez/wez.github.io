I've been lucky enough to have been paid to do some work on the PHP/PECL soap extension over the last couple of days.

I'd like to think that it is a hell of a lot better now than it was when I started - it <strong>did</strong> segfault when you tried just about anything, and now you can actually use it.  Less memory leaks, more fun.

Or something like that.
