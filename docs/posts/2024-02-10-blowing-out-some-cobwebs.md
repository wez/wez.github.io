title: Blowing out some cobwebs

It's been a long time since I last wrote anything new here, so long in fact,
that BitBucket killed their Mercurial product which was hosting a number of my
Open Source projets, Google killed their analytics product (and migrated it to
something else that I don't care to adopt), and my hair has turned mostly silver!

It's long overdue for a bit of a dusting out of cobwebs, and I fancied a bit of
a change from my normal weekend activities, so I sat down to do that this
weekend.

For some time now, dependabot has been nagging me about some ruby ecosystem
security issue or other as a result of this site being based on Jekyll, and I
desired to never see such a thing again. So, as part of dusting things off, I
migrated over to [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

What's changed? Not too much really; I've updated some of the information
about me and my projects and added a more recent photo. The fanciest part
of this update is that there is now a Dark Mode!

> Does this mean you're going to start blogging more regularly than once a decade!?

I'm not sure. If there's something you'd like me to talk
about here, @-me on [fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@wez) and let's see.
