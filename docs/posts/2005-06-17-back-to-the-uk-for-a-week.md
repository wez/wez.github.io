<p>I'm about to depart for the UK for the <a href="http://www.inbox-outbox.com/">Inbox Outbox conference</a>.  I'm leaving a little early so that I can fit in some family and friends time over the weekends and some other business either side of the conference itself.   </p>
<p>Normally, I would say something about having choppy internet access, but given that I have none at home right now, whatever I'll have will be better than nothing.  I hope. :)  </p>
