<p>I've updated EvilDesk again.  Aside from fixing a couple of bugs here and there, it now features built-in support for &quot;Safer&quot; execution of internet facing applications.   </p>
<p>Find out more on the <a href="http://evildesk.wezfurlong.org">EvilDesk Home Page</a> (I've added a ChangeLog section for your tracking pleasure).   </p>
