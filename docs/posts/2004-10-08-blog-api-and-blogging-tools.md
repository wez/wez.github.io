<p>After reading <a href="http://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/blog/archives/285_Soliciting_Opinions.html">George's solicitation</a>, I decided to take a look around for win32 offline blogging apps.  The two I looked at this morning (w.bloggar and SharpMT) didn't work with my old 'zlog, which is a bit annoying.  From what I could see, w.bloggar uses methods not supported by s9y and SharpMT is broken (the correct responses were being sent, it just kept thinking that there was an HTTP violation).   </p>
<p>Is there good, bloat-free (or at least, not over bloated) app for win32? Is there one for linux ?  </p>
