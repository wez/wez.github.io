<p>Having been frustrated by the length of time that it takes to build the substantial PHP manual from its XML sources (45 minutes or so), I hacked together a nice simple but effective tool (using PHP, of course!) to index the DocBook sources (takes less than 2 minutes), and transform the XML into HTML on-the-fly.</p><p>You only need to re-index the content if you add a new node or a new XML file. Any changes you make to your docs are then &quot;instantly&quot; visible in your browser.</p><p>It's almost the same as having a WYSIWYG editor, but without the agony of fighting with their &quot;intelligent&quot; code mangling.</p><p>I'm planning to package this up as a more generic tool (so that I can apply it to my own internal documentation) and make it available for download from <a href="http://thebrainroom.com/opensource/livedocs.php">http://thebrainroom.com/opensource/livedocs.php</a>.</p><p>You can see a sample of the output at <a href="http://www.php.net/~wez/fopen.html">http://www.php.net/~wez/fopen.html</a>.
