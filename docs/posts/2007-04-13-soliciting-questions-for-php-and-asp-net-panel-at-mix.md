<p>As I mentioned previously, I'll be at <a href="http://visitmix.com/">MIX</a> this year on a panel discussing ASP and PHP interoperability, along with <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/239">Jesse Liberty</a>, <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/bills/default.aspx">Bill Staples</a>, <a href="http://www.joeon.net/">Joe Stagner</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bgold/">Brian Goldfarb</a>.   </p>
<p>I've been told that MIX has sold out and that there is a lot of interest in our slot, so I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about, but I'm looking for questions to break the ice and get things rolling.   </p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments or other insights on PHP running on Windows, or on getting PHP apps working together with ASP.net apps, please comment on this blog post, and I'll try to work them into the panel, and to feed back the results of the discussion here on my blog.   </p>
<p>If for some reason your comment doesn't go through, or if you prefer email, you can also mail them to me at wez@php.net.   </p>
