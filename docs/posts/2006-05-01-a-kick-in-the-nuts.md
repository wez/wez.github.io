<p><a href="http://phpdeveloper.org/news/5259">Flurong!?</a>.  I thought RSS was supposed to help avoid things like mis-spelling the names of the people you're syndicating.  Double-nut-pain is scored for making the same typo twice. Ouch. :)   </p>
<p>I know that phpdeveloper.org produced by human hands, and I'm not knocking the summaries at all; it would just be nice to have at least our names correctly spelled, in case they are re-syndicated from there and the typo propogated around the 'net.  </p>
