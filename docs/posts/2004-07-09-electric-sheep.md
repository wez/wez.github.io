<p>It's gotta be the coolest screensaver ever, <a href="http://www.electric-sheep.org/">electric sheep</a> is a continually evolving flame fractal animated screen saver, where your idle cpu cycles are used as part of a distributed computing network to render frames towards the next phase in the evolution (known as sheep).   </p>
<p>The name is a little strange, but if you consider idle cpu cycles as dreams, and consider the novel &quot;Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;, you'll get the idea.  (If you're more into movies than books, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is for you).   </p>
<p>It is a little slow to pick up the first &quot;sheep&quot;, but that appears to be a bandwidth problem on their central server.  Perhaps they should also distribute the sheep downloads among mirrors, or even peers (Bit Torrent style)?   </p>
<p>Anyway, the coolest thing about this screen saver is that is subtly changing the whole time; I have it running on a spare computer next to me and its fascinating.  </p>
