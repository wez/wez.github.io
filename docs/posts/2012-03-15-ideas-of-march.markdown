This time last year, [Chris wrote about blogging](http://shiflett.org/blog/2011/mar/ideas-of-march) and how
Twitter has reduced the quality of online discussions by shifting the
focus from longer form discussions to shorter tweets.  He was hoping
that he could foster something of a blog revival, and did for a while.

This year Chris is hoping for more of the same, and invited a number of
folks to join in to see if we can get some more momentum going.

I personally prefer reading blogs to reading things on Twitter:

 * I like being able to focus on things for more than a few words at a
   time, and find the broken/abbreviated form of English that
   texting and twitter encourage to be borderline disrespectful towards
   the reader--if you've got something worthy to say, take the time to
   say it properly!
 * I can more easily find and subscribe to writers of content that I
   like.
 * I can read the content on my time-frame, rather than being compelled
   to watch the twitter stream to catch what's going on.
 * I can more easily search and find the things I'm looking for.

I also like to blog, but have found it difficult to make time to turn out
content of the quality that I prefer.  I hope to change that this year,
and blog some more.  I'd also like to see you blog more too.
