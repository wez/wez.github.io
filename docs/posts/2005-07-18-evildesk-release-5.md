<p>I've updated EvilDesk yet again this weekend.  The biggest new thing is making all the hotkeys (aside from alt-tab) user configurable.   </p>
<p>Find out more on the <a href="http://evildesk.wezfurlong.org">EvilDesk Home Page</a> (I've added a ChangeLog section for your tracking pleasure).   </p>
