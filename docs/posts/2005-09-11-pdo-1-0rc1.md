<p>I spent pretty much all day working through the outstanding PDO bugs listed on bugs.php.net and pecl.php.net.  There are now no known problems with any of the main-stream drivers, so I've bumped the version numbers up to 1.0RC1 and released them via PECL (ODBC and OCI package releases are pending build/install tests).   </p>
<p>Please make the effort to download and use them so that we can catch any remaining bugs; we're getting <b>very</b> close to PHP 5.1 stable, and I really want you to catch any problems with the way that <b>you</b> use it before the release date, rather than the day after.   </p>
<p>I've also been fleshing out the PDO docs in the PHP online manual; those changes will be picked up when it is next built and pushed to the mirrors.   </p>
<p>Enjoy!  </p>
