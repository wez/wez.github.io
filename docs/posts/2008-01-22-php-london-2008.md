<p>I was scheduled to appear at PHP London 2008, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I've had to cancel my trip and back out from the conference.  I don't like doing this, but unfortunately don't have much of a choice.  Thankfully, the PHP London folks have managed to find replacement speakers for the two sessions that I was going to give.
</p><p>If you're going to be in or around London on the leap day (February 29<sup>th</sup>), or are within commutable distance, then you might consider attending the conference; it's a one day conference with a number of expert speakers from the PHP Community.  If you sign up now, the early bird rate is only GBP 90.  <a href="http://www.phpconference.co.uk/">Find out more at their web site</a>.
</p><p>I was really looking forward to this conference, and I'm sorry that I'm going to miss it; I hope you have fun!</p>
