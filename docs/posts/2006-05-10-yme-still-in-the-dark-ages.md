<p>I'm getting more and more irritated with windows apps that assume that they can do stuff that requires administrative privileges, like automatically install updates.   </p>
<p>I don't run as an administrator because I don't want internet facing apps to mangle my system if/when they get hacked.  For the past week I've been telling yahoo music engine that I don't want to upgrade now.  It should be smart enough to realize that I don't have administrative rights and not prompt me.   </p>
<p>Just now, I started to play a track and it gave me no option: it started to download the 8MB update with no way to cancel the operation, then attempted to install it, which failed.   </p>
<p>While I'm not especially irritated by &quot;do you want to upgrade now?&quot; dialogs, I am very irritated by something that forces me to waste bandwidth on a download that I can't run.  I don't even know where it downloaded the update to, so I might even have to download it again as the administrator.  Ah, there it is: it was downloaded to %TEMP% with a temporary filename and a .tmp file extension.   </p>
<p>This sucks; yahoo, fix your stuff.   </p>
