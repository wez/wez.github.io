<p>It saddens (and annoys) me that someone promoting PHP conferences has subscribed me (and presumably other php core developers) to mailing lists containing more information than I ever wanted to know about their events--without my permission.   </p>
<p>I don't mind the odd <b>useful</b> email here or there, but I've had enough of them recently to prompt me to take the time to unsubscribe and to blog about it.  The chances of me associating myself with them or their conferences, in either attendee or speaker capacity are now pretty damned slim.   </p>
<p>Am I just being touchy, or feeling overly self important?  I don't think so.  It's my inbox; don't sign me up for stuff that I didn't ask for.  I consider that <b>really</b> bad behaviour.  OS Events--consider your wrists slapped.  </p>
