<p>I was asked to review <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131483986/qid=1098542552/sr=2-2/ref=pd_ka_b_2_2/002-5173820-1735208">this book</a> recently (with an eye on how it equates to PHP), and having just gone through it, I'm quite impressed.  It is well written, well structured (taking you from no knowledge and going from there) and teaches you good design principles, without beating you over the head with them.   </p>
<p>Having completed my review, it is apparent that PHP 5 has most of the good parts from java, without bogging you down in syntax.  I view this as a good thing, making it easier for programmers to drift between the two languages more easily.   </p>
<p>If I was asked to recommend a book on java programming, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one.  I would even consider recommending it to someone new to programming, because most of what it teaches applies equally well to other languages; it serves as a very useful primer, going into the right amount of detail, to make future employees useful regardless of the language that you're going to use.   </p>
