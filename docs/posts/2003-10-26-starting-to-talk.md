<p>The biggest drawback to going to conferences is that I'm missing my wonderful wife Juliette and our son Xander.  Xander is 11 months old and has been chatting away saying na-na for a few months now.</p><p>Since I've been away on this trip, he's started to say da-da and today he said ma-ma.  Thanks to the wonders of technology, Juliette was able to make a quick mpeg so that I don't feel that I'm totally missing out.  This brings tears to my eyes because Xander isn't feeling very well right now (he's having trouble keeping his food down), so he doesn't look quite so bright as he does usually.</p><p><a href="http://pics.thebrainroom.net/albums/Xander/da_da.mpg">da-da</a></p>
