<p>A couple of years back, we attended the wedding of my sister-in-law (<a href="http://www.theartrocks.com/tgactnw/44macauley.html">Aimee Macauley</a>) in Hawaii.  We decided to extend our stay and were treated to a big cock-up on behalf of United Airlines that involved flying from Hawaii-&gt;SFO-&gt;Boston-&gt;NY-&gt;NY-&gt;LHR, instead of the somewhat more sane Hawaii-&gt;SFO-&gt;LHR.   </p>
<p>Well, I've just been visting <a href="http://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/blog/">George</a> (for business, and as it turns out, pleasure too) and my &quot;travel-luck&quot; (those are Dr. Evil finger-quotation-marks) strikes again.  The flight from BWI to Boston was delayed enough by some weather (presumably the same lightning storms that delayed my inbound flight a couple of days earlier) to mess up my connecting flight back to LHR (you know; the important one).   </p>
<p>This time I'm flying American Airlines and I have to commend them for <b>much</b> nicer service than United.  I'm currently sitting in Chicago O'Hare waiting for my alternate flight to LHR.  My arrival time has been delayed approx 5 hours, but it turns out that this actually a better schedule for both myself and Juliette+Xander; I get more time to &quot;sleep&quot; on the plane (Dr. Evil finger-quotes again), and they don't have to get up at 4am to collect me from the airport.   </p>
