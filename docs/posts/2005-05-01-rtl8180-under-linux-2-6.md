<p>You need to use ndiswrapper and the driver from the RealTek site; using the driver provided on the CD that came with my cheapo pcmcia card led to a panic on startup.   </p>
<p>Update: According to Russel Phillips (some guy I don't know--his words :-) Realtek have recently released a <a href="http://w3serv.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloads1-3.aspx?lineid=2002111&amp;famid=2002111&amp;series=2002121&amp;Software=True">Linux 2.6 driver for this chap</a>.  I've not tested this yet, as I'm not sure where I put the pcmcia card, and the ipw2200 driver for my internal wifi works like a champ.   </p>
