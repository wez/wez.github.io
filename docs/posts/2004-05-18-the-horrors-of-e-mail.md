<p><img align="right" src="/images/phpa-30-cover.jpg.t" alt="phpa-30-cover.jpg.t"/> If you've ever wanted to send more than a basic email through PHP, or perform some processing on existing messages, then you might find my article in <a href="http://www.phparch.com/issue.php?mid=30">the May 2004 issue of php|architect</a> a useful resource.   </p>
<p>In the article, I provide you with a functional overview of the major RFCs, some hints on things to watch out for and tips on how best to do things to avoid your mail getting mangled in transit.  </p>
