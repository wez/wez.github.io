I'm an experienced software engineer and entrepreneur. A lot of what I've built
over the years is Open Source. If you've ever browsed the web or received an
email there's a strong chance that my software was involved. You can [learn
more about me over here](about.md).  I offer [Mentoring](mentoring.md) services!

Find me on [:fontawesome-brands-mastodon: @wez@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@wez).
