# About Wez

![Wez Furlong](/images/wez-portrait.jpg){ class=float-right-mug }

I'm an experienced software engineer and entrepreneur. A lot of what I've build
over the years is Open Source. I'm originally from England but I've lived in
the USA for a long time. I'm currently based in Arizona. I like to unwind with
an occasional single malt and a good movie. If I can't get my hands on those,
I'll substitute bourbon, bad sci-fi or gaming.
