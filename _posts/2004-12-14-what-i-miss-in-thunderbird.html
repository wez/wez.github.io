<p>Is the ability to display a couple of extra non-standard headers in addition to the usual From, Subject and Date stuff.   </p>
<p>I know I can turn on <b>all</b> the headers, but that's just a bit too much noise.   </p>
<p>Maybe someone out there can write an extension for that?   </p>
<p>[PS: I know this isn't strictly PHP based, but since I spend a lot of time managing the php.net mail server, I guess it could be construed as PHP].  </p>
