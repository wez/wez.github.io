<p>After looking at jBlog and a number of other PHP applications, I realized that they are all trying to do the same things during installation, some more competent than others.</p><p>Sooo... why isn't there a tool, like InstallShield or MSI as seen on win32, for packaging and managing the tricky installation and initial configuration of PHP (web) applications?</p><p>Well, I'm working on one now :-)
