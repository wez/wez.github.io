<p>Juliette and myself particularly enjoyed the character Qui-Gon Jinn from <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120915/">Episode 1</a>.  Apparently <a href="http://members.tripod.com/magicfirefly/pg_qj_fanart/qj_fanart_maaike.htm">we are not alone</a> (warning: readers of an evil disposition should not view that page!).   </p>
<p>We don't really think of Qui-Gon as <a href="http://members.tripod.com/magicfirefly/qj_fanart/msupe5052.jpg">hot stuff</a>, but we really do enjoy seeing a strong character with a good sense of morality and balance, especially one so believable (light-sabers and mind tricks aside).   </p>
<p>If Episode 1 didn't have enough Qui-Gon for you, I suggest watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0114287/">Rob Roy</a>.  </p>
