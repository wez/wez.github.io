<p><a href='http://php-con.com/2003/west/'><img border='0' hspace='5' align='right' src='/images/phpcon_125x125_speaker.gif'></a>I will be <a href="http://www.php-con.com/2003/west/program/abstract/extending-php.php">speaking at PHP{Con West</a> this year about how to write a PHP extension.  It will be a 3 hour tutorial, so I will be able to go through the whole process and even talk about some of the "black magic" that goes into some of the more advanced features of the PHP/Zend extension API.</p><p>I'll also be hanging around at the <a href="http://php-con.com/2003/west/code-sprint.php">Code Sprint</a>, not necessarily coding, but available to answer any questions you might have about PHP (preferably internals questions!).</p>
