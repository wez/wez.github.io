<p>Thanks to Bill Abt and Rick McGuire of IBM, preliminary documentation for <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/internals.pdo.php">writing a PDO driver</a> is now part of the PHP manual.   </p>
<p>It was originally written against an earlier of incarnation of PDO, so some parts may not be 100% correct.  If you're thinking of adding support for other databases to PHP, then you should read the howto and give it a whirl.  If you find an inaccuracy, drop a line to pecl-dev@lists.php.net and we'll set you straight and fix the docs.  </p>
