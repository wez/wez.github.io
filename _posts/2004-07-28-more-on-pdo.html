<p>Just published today on the Oracle Technology Network is <a href="http://otn.oracle.com/pub/articles/php_experts/otn_pdo_oracle5.html">my article on PDO</a>, giving an overview of what it is, installation, sample code, portability and so on.   </p>
<p>Although it has a focus on Oracle, pretty much everything covered there should be portable to the other available pdo drivers with minimal changes (essentially just the parameters to your connection), if you are writing portable SQL.   </p>
<p>Please do read it, even if you're only mildly curious, as the stipend I earned from writing the article effectively paid for some of my time working on PDO.  As it was actually written a few weeks back (OTN has a long publishing process), the &quot;Future of&quot; section is missing details of the iterator (eg: foreach) support that Marcus keeps nagging me to merge in.   </p>
