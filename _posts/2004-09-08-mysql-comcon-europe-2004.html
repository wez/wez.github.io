<p><b>The Shaken (but not stirred) Announcement</b>   </p>
<p>Recipe for MySQL ComCon Europe 2004: <ul>
<li>Take equal parts kick-ass MySQL community event and MySQL mission-critical business event.
 <li>Add key MySQL community members and developers.
 <li>Drop in three days in November (8th to 10th).
 <li>Shake well.
 <li>Serve ice cold at <a href="http://mysqlcomconeurope.com/">http://mysqlcomconeurope.com/</a>.
   </ul>
<p>If you're interested in attending, by all means beg/bribe, borrow or steal to get there; a lot of effort has gone into organizing the event, particularly into getting the developers to be at the same place at the same time, so make the most of it!   </p>
