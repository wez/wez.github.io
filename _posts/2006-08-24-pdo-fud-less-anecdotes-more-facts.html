<p>I was just skimming over <a href="http://www.santosj.name/php/why-sdo-doesnt-take-off/">Santos' Post about SDO</a>, and was saddened to see more anecdotes and less facts.   </p>
<p>Here are two points that you should take note of:   </p>
<p><ul>
<li>PDO <b>is</b> an &quot;ultra fast direct layer to the database&quot;.
 <li>The <a href="http://dealnews.com/developers/php-mysql.html">benchmarks I think you're referring to</a> do not include the <a href="/blog/2006/apr/using-pdo-mysql">magic turbo switch I talk about here</a>, that highlights performance problems when using prepared statements, which are on by default.
   </ul>
<p>I'd love to see someone run some fair comparisons and publish the numbers.  </p>
