<p>I got confirmation of my H1-B visa last night, which means that I can finally arrange those little things (like my flight and where I'm going to live) that have been dependent on this news.   </p>
<p>For those that don't yet know, I've taken a position as Senior Systems Engineer at <a href="http://omniti.com">OmniTI Computer Consulting, Inc.</a>, to work with <a href="http://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/blog/">George</a> and <a href="http://lethargy.org/~jesus/">Theo</a> on (among other things) anti-spam solutions for <a href="http://omniti.com/solutions/ecelerity.php">the fastest MTA on Earth</a>.   </p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to making the move in a couple of weeks time!  </p>
