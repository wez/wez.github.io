<p>This year, join Marcus Boerger, Sara Golemon and myself in an intense 3 hour tutorial covering everything we can possibly fit in the slot on the topic of <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_sess/12755">Extending/Embedding PHP</a>.  Just in case you didn't know it, the three of us form something of a power trio when it comes to PHP internals, so who better to give such a tutorial eh?  Having given my share of talks on this topic in the past, I'm not joking when I say it isn't for the faint hearted; there's a lot of material and 3 hours is short (we wanted a longer slot, but we'll take what we're given).  Oh yes, it kicks off at 8:30am on the first day.  Make sure you are suitably caffeinated for the kick-off and throughout.
</p><p>Later in the week, at the more respectable time of 1:45pm, I'll be giving my <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_sess/12933">PDO talk</a> again.  I've been given a 45 minute slot again, which is a tad tight, so I'll do my best to avoid spilling over into the next talk.
</p><p>OSCON is my favorite conference; there's a lot of diversity in the content and the people which makes an excellent melting pot for ideas. It's interesting and a lot of fun; the conference highlight of the year. I'm looking forward to it, and to perhaps seeing you there.</p>
