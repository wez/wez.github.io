<p>A bit lax in getting these online; I bought a new HD for my laptop while in portland, so it's been mildly difficult to get at the slides themselves.   </p>

<p>OSCON was a blast; good to see the usual gang again, good to put faces to people that I hadn't previously met, and good to meet new people.  Looking forward to going again next year :-)   </p>
