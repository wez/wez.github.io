title: My Facebook Adventure
---

Earlier this year I made a difficult choice: to leave Message Systems
and join Facebook.

I moved countries to work with OmniTI/Message Systems 
[back in 2004](http://wezfurlong.org/blog/2004/nov/here-in-usa/), and
I've worked with the team for almost 8 years, seen things grow
from a couple of engineers and a sales guy to a company with multiple
offices in the USA, Europe and Asia/Pacific.  In my time with the
company I've learned a lot about many things, worked hard with some
great people and had good times.

So why leave?  It was time to try something new.  My day-to-day had
settled into a fairly repetitive and steady pattern and there wasn't a
huge amount going on in the neighborhood where I lived; rural Maryland
isn't exactly a hotbed of activity!  Add to that the oppressive
humidity in the summer and the snow in the winter, I felt like I was
never really all that comfortable getting out of the house.

So it was time to try something new, and the time was right to give
Facebook a shot.

My last day at Message Systems was the start of June; we parted
on very amicable terms and I'm going to miss the team:

## Facebook

After talking with a couple of different folks about possible futures,
I'd settled on Facebook as my next great adventure.

While the hiring/interview process was a little bumpy, I had a lot of
excitement around the sorts of things that Facebook are doing, and it
really seemed like they had a lot of fun working hard.

I've been a full-time employee of Facebook for just shy of a month, and I'm
blown away.  The on-boarding process is well structured, fun, and
informative.  Facebook believes very strongly in enabling you to get
stuff done with minimal obstruction and there's a great vibe on campus.

We work hard and play hard; there's opportunity to blow off steam in
many ways, and this is actively encouraged by the culture to help keep
folks energized.  I've had code deployed to the main facebook web site
within days of joining, expanded a high performing internal service
in C, changed RPC interfaces, worked in Xcode, changed some Flash code,
learned new build/push infrastructure and tooling and more.  The scale
of our operations is staggering and amazing, and the pace is rapid.

I've commented a lot on my Facebook timeline about the perks and
activities (which often include alcohol!) that keep it feeling fun.  I'm
sure my family and friends think I'm partying all the time, but that's
because I can't post details of the work I'm doing and that biases the
results.

The campus has modern fittings and has a kind of industrial
engineering-in-progress feel to it that helps reinforce the culture: the
not-quite-finished look reminds us that our journey is not done and that
we're continuing to iterate building and improving our services and
apps.

One of my criteria for the next big adventure was that the climate be
more conducive to getting me outside, and California scores highly in
this department:

## Moving

So far I've been staying in temporary accomodation in Mountain View.
The next thing on my agenda is getting the family relocated from
Maryland to the Bay Area.  As usual, I hate having to deal with the
logistics of moving, but can't wait to establish a more permanent base
out here.

As first steps go, off to an amazing start, but this journey is only 1%
finished.
