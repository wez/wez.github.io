<p>I was treated to this, ridiculously wide, &quot;dialog&quot; just now:   </p>
<p><img src="/images/mandatoryupgrade.png" alt="mandatoryupgrade.png"/>   </p>
<p>again, no option to cancel, and no brains to realize that I don't have the required privileges, and no option to avoid the 8MB download that won't buy me anything.   </p>
<p>I'm just glad that I don't have to quit everything just because some app decides that I have to.  On the flip side, it interrupted my listening pleasure, so I'm tetchy.   </p>
<p>Maybe this update has fixes for these things... but I'll apply that &quot;mandatory&quot; upgrade when I want to do it.   </p>
