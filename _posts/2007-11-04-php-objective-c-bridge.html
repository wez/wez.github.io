<p>I've had some code hanging around on my laptop for the better part of a year (feels like two, but I don't think I've had my MBP that long), that implements a bridge between PHP and the Objective-C runtime.  This is similar in spirit to <a href="http://camelbones.sourceforge.net/">CamelBones</a> and <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a>, but obviously a bit less mature.
</p><p>Yesterday I debugged the last portion that I regarded as a total showstopper for anyone else that might want to use it, and added a script that pulls in your PHP installation and dependent libraries (such as Fink or Mac Ports libraries) and generates a "Bundle" and optionally a DMG containing the Bundle.  I also persuaded <a href="http://jan.prima.de/">Jan</a> to try it out on Leopard, and discovered that Apple has deprecated most of the things I've been using for this (doh!) but we got it working on Leopard too. (note: you'll need to build your own PHP on Leopard, the one Apple ships has had its exports stripped, so you can't run the extension--it'll build, but not run)
</p><p>There's still some way to go before I consider this "nice" to use, but it's a solid start.  Jan built a simple GUI for the ping command:

	</p><p>I want to underscore that this is still in the very early stages, and that you'll most likely need a good bit of C and Objective-C savvy to get the most out of it right now, and that neither Jan nor myself can guarantee to fix problems that arise, but I in the spirit of release early, release often, I've put the code into the PHP CVS repository in the php-objc module, and created a php-objc mailing list on the PHP list server.
</p><p>So, if you can figure out how to get at the code and on the mailing list, welcome!  If you can't, it's too early for you to participate; you'll need to hold tight until we've made things easier to use.</p>
