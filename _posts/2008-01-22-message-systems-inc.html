<p>At the start of this year, we spun off the email product side of <a href="http://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a> into its own entity, <a href="http://messagesystems.com/">Message Systems, Inc</a>.  This marks another step on the road to dominating the world with our awesome software.
</p><p>I've also changed roles; I'm now the Director of Engineering at Message Systems.  I'm looking forward to see what challenges are in store for me, and will try hard to avoid adopting too much suit talk (I've already found myself using a few phrases that would have made me cringe last year).
</p><p>What does this mean for me and PHP?  Despite the increased responsibility, I think it should actually give me a bit more PHP time than I've had in the past (I'll have more control over my destiny).  I should still be able to attend PHP related events, and I still deal with PHP (we use it for the management GUI in the product).
</p><p>What about OmniTI?  Well, we're still part of the family and share office space, jokes and good times at our HQ in Maryland.</p>
