<p>I've just finished chatting with Marcus Whitney for part of the next installment of his <a href="http://www.pro-php.com/">Pro PHP Podcast</a> show.  It's my first recorded conversation/interview for public consumption.  I'm kinda nervous and hope that I didn't ramble on too much.  But that's what it's all about; getting more personality out of people than you would with just text alone.   </p>
<p>As ever, technology has a wicked sense of humour, so there are probably going to be a couple of stops-and-starts (perhaps more if I really rambled on and Marcus has to edit ;-).  Oh yeah, I might come across as sounding more like Barry White than I would normally.   </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing how the show develops--listening rather than reading is not just a refreshing change but also something you can do while working on other things.   </p>
<p>The next installment of the show should hit the 'net in the next couple of days.  </p>
