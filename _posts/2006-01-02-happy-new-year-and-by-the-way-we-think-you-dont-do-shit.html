<p>I have to say that I'm disgusted at the attitude of two of our prominent PHP developers.   </p>
<p>PHP is a volunteer project guys.  If you don't like the fact that I lead a very busy professional life then that's your problem.   </p>
<p>I know how many hours I've spent developing PHP and maintaining its systems over the last year.  (Guess who gets paged when our mail systems run into problems?)   </p>
<p>Getting snarky because I'm on vacation for a week is just plain wrong.  Really.   </p>
<p>PS: if you think that attitude will motivate me into doing more for PHP you're wrong.  It just makes me want to go and do <b>anything</b> else instead.  </p>
