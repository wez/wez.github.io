<p>[Update: Beta 3 is out; please report any/all bugs via http://bugs.php.net]   </p>
<p>With the impending release of PHP 5.1b3, it's a good time to mention the status of PDO.  We've had an excellent round of QA since beta 2, resulting in the following notable items:   </p>
<p><ul>
<li>common core test suite to ensure individual driver conformance
 <li>MySQL and PostgreSQL drivers now support native prepared statements and bound parameters (when available), for improved performance.
 <li>OCI and ODBC drivers have been improved.
 <li>PDOStatement::closeCursor() method has been added, to explicitly free up a database connection if you're done with a result set before you reach the end.
 <li>Added $db-&gt;getAttribute(PDO_ATTR_DRIVER_NAME) to tell you which driver is in use (mostly useful for people writing layers over the top of PDO).
 <li>Enabled the unix build of PDO_DBLIB, which provides access to Sybase/MSSQL servers via freetds.  This driver is not as mature as the others, so feedback is especially welcomed.  If you're running on windows, you'll probably have a better experience using PDO_ODBC to talk to SQL Server.
 <li>There are no unresolved bugs (a couple of feature requests, but no bugs)
   </ul>
<p>Enjoy :)  </p>
