<p>I've got a couple of full-time positions open on my engineering team.  We believe in a fun but focused development environment: open-plan, flexible hours, and great benefits.  Our customers include Fortune-500 companies, hot startups and tier-1 telecommunications carriers.  Our software helps those customers deliver billions of email messages per day.
</p><h2>Email Infrastructure Software Engineer (x2)
</h2><p>I'm looking for one mid-level and one mid-to-senior-level engineer with strong "C" programming skills (3+ years of professional experience).  These roles involve design, implementation and testing of our flagship email server product.  E-mail encompasses a very broad range of standards and specifications which in turn means that our code base touches on a little bit of everything; it's both interesting and challenging.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/27e974">[Full Job Description]</a>
	</p><h2>Gozer (The Destructor) 
</h2><p>I'm also looking for someone with a knack for breaking things.  This person would be dedicated to dreaming up ways to make the product stress out, panic and fall over, and distilling that abuse into test cases to run in our white box, smoke testing, stress and soak testing environments.  This position requires strong Perl skills and 3-5 years industry experience.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ypkhwc">[Full Job Description]</a>
