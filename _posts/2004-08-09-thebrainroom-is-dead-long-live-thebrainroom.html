<p>This weekend I stripped out my office (affectionately entitled The Brain Room) ready to have it redecorated in such a way that it doesn't look like something the borg created, and that will have a positive effect on the sale of the house.   </p>
<p>My nice (cheap and elderly) L-shaped desk fell apart during the move--luckily <b>after</b> I moved the 17&quot; and 22&quot; monitors that sat upon into a spare room--phew!, and I've powered down half the machines I was running in there.   </p>
<p>I also had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of sorting through the last 2.5 years worth of the MSDN universal far east pack... on CD media.   I dutifully scratched 9 boxes full of CD's (although, to be honest, finding someone around here that could actually make use of Japanese, Korean and Chinese MS developer software is probably a tall order) and took them to the recycling centre, where they were unable to recycle them--doh!   </p>
<p>So, I'm now working in the new Brain Room, a 6'x8' ish little room we had spare on the other side of the house; it's cosy and isolated enough that I  have been even more productive here than the old room.  </p>
