<p>How many people are seriously using Win9x with PHP?   </p>
<p>There are quite a few APIs that are either server-only or Win2k and up that PHP would benefit from using.  Before we just go ahead and use them (breaking support for Win9x) I thought it would be a good idea to find out how many people this will affect.   </p>
<p>So, if you use, or know of someone that uses PHP on Win95, Win98 or WinME, please add a comment here, explaining why, so we can guage how much of an impact bumping the version requirements for PHP would have.   </p>
<p>Thanks!  </p>
