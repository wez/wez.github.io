<p>As I've had a couple of people ask me for them recently, I sat down and cooked up PECL packages for PDO and its drivers tonight (except firebird, but...) so that they can be used with PHP 5.0.3 and up.   </p>
<p>The PECL packages are literally the same code thats in CVS HEAD (and thus the CVS snapshots), so if you're running a PHP 5.1 beta, you should stick with <a href="http://snaps.php.net">the CVS snapshots</a>.   </p>
<p>If you're upgrading older PDO releases that you installed via PECL, you will need to upgrade PDO and all the PDO drivers that you had installed (the drivers check to make sure that they are compatible with the version of PDO you have installed when they are loaded; if they are not, then PHP/Apache will refuse to start).   </p>
