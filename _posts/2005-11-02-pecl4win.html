<p>I don't know if you're all aware of <a href="http://pecl4win.php.net">pecl4win.php.net</a>.  This new service, graciously provided by <a href="http://emini.dk">Emini A/S</a>, continually builds PECL extensions against the various different branches of PHP so that you can very easily find the latest version of a given PECL extension to match the version of PHP that you're running.   </p>
<p>Edin Kadribasic from Emini has been looking after the official Windows build of PHP (he builds our Windows distribution) for some time, and this service is his latest innovation; thanks Edin!  </p>
