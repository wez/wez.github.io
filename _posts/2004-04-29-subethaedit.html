<p><img align="right" src="/images/screenshot-minutes.jpg.t" alt="SubEthaEdit in action"/> I had the pleasure of using <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> today.  Both myself and <a href="http://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/blog/">George</a> needed to edit some text at the same time (literally!) and he mentioned that it was a shame that I didn't have a Mac, because we could use SubEthaEdit if I did.  Well, as it turns out, I do have a Mac hanging around here.   </p>
<p>I was a bit sceptical at first; I don't particular like Mac, even though OSX is not too bad.  But, WOW, SubEthaEdit just works.  I can see George typing stuff and his changes are in a different pastel colour from mine.  What a great tool.   </p>
<p>Now, why don't we have this tool for platforms other than OSX?  Looking at their site, the SubEthaEdit people seem particularly elitist about it being Mac-only and they don't want to OpenSource it (fair enough).   </p>
<p>It's tempting to start another one of my world-domination attempts by writing my own version of this app using, say, wxWidgets.  </p>
