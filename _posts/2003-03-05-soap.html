<p><img border='0' alt='Soap' hspace='5' align='left' src='/images/loofa_soap.jpg'> I've been lucky enough to have been paid to do some work on the PHP/PECL soap extension over the last couple of days.</p><p>I'd like to think that it is a hell of a lot better now than it was when I started - it <strong>did</strong> segfault when you tried just about anything, and now you can actually use it.  Less memory leaks, more fun.</p><p>Or something like that.</p>
