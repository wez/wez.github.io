<p>[Update: I've put these parser/lexer tools on BitBucket and Github; enjoy!]</p>

<p>From time to time, I find that I need to put a parser together.  Most of the time I find that I need to do this in C for performance, but other times I just want something convenient, like PHP, and have been out of luck.   </p>
<p>This thanksgiving I set out to remedy this and adapted <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/lemon.html">lemon</a> to optionally emit PHP code, and likewise with <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/">JLex</a>.   </p>
<p>You need a C compiler to build lemon and a java compiler and runtime to build and run JLexPHP, but after having translated your .y and .lex files with these tools, you're left with a pure PHP parser and lexer implementation.</p>
<p>The parser and lexer generators are available under a BSDish license, from both BitBucket and Github:</p>
