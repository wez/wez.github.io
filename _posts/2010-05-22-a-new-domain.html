<p>
	I'm letting thebrainroom.com lapse this year after holding it for 11
	years.  For those that weren't with me back then, The Brain Room was my
	consulting company, providing graphic and software design services.
</p>
<p>
	When I joined <a href="http://omniti.com">OmniTI</a>, I chose netevil.org
	to use for my blog in a kind of self-mocking move; I equated my efforts at
	taking over the world with superior software with the effectiveness of Dr.
	Evil.  A lot of people thought I was styling myself after Dr. Evil, which
	wasn't quite right, but close enough :-)
</p>
<p>
	Since I've been going around updating my account information with various
	services, I thought a change would be in order.  I'm of the opinion
	that one should use their own name as part of their internet persona,
	I finally got a domain that did just that.
</p>
<p>
	So here we are: <a href="http://wezfurlong.org">wezfurlong.org</a>.  I've
	taken the opportunity to give things a really minor facelift, and also
	migrated comments to the <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> service.
</p>
<p>
	The move may cause a re-post of some of my articles to aggregating
	services; I apologize for that.  netevil.org is not going anywhere anywhere
	soon, but if you have me on file using thebrainroom.com, you will need to
	update your information to wezfurlong.org instead.
