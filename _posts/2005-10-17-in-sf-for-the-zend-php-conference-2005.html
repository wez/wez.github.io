<p>It's been a long, busy weekend for me; we had our whole house carpeted on saturday, which meant moving all our furniture around.  I also built a new bed for Xander; I'm sore from the physical effort and mentally tired from not having any time to unwind.  I was up at 4am this morning in preparation for my flight to SF at 7am, and had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of the never-ending morning that goes hand in hand with flying west.  All that combined with the customary airplane headache has me feeling pretty beat up.   </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the conference; meeting the usual crowd is always good... and this time around we're &quot;business focused&quot;, which should put a bit of a different spin on things... hopefully for the better :-)  </p>
