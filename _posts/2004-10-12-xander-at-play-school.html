<p><img align="right" src="/images/xander_zoo.jpg.t" alt="xander_zoo.jpg.t"/> Xander had his first half-day at play school today.  He was a little unsettled about not having either Juliette or myself near-by, but enjoyed being in the company of other kids his own age.   </p>
<p><img align="left" src="/images/xander_art.jpg.t" alt="xander_art"/> He produced his first artistic piece, without the aid of crayons, pictured to the left.  The piece features the colour red and his favourite shape--the circle.   </p>
