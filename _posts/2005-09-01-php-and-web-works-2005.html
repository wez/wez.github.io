<p><img align="right" src="/images/phpworks5.png" alt=""/> I'm looking forward to php|works this year.  I have the privilege of presenting two sessions; the &quot;usual&quot; PDO talk and my &quot;lucky dip&quot; streams talk (a mixture of streams related things), which seemed to go down quite well with the attendees of php|tropics.   </p>
<p>See you there?   </p>
