<p>I found the time to fix up my ffi extension so that it largely usable;
the main features that are missing are support for arrays and closures
(aka callbacks), but it should otherwise be good enough for some
hacking.</p><p>ffi is multiplatform, and should work on a wide variety of unices as well
as the known-good platforms: Linux/x86, Win32 and OSX.</p><p>If you want to try it on win32, you can download the <a href="http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_UNSTABLE/php_ffi.dll">PECL binary for windows</a>; this is updated each time the PHP 5 snapshot is rebuilt--every 3 hours or so.</p><p>If you want to try it on other platforms, use <code>pear install ffi</code> to install and build the code from source; you need to have previously installed PHP 5 to use ffi.</p><p><a href="http://pecl.php.net/package-info.php?package=ffi">FFI package page</a>
