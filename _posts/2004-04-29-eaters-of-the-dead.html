I loved the story, having recently become a father and very recently just been in/around Silicon Valley.  I even got Juliette to read it, and now she's gone Crichton mad.   </p>
<p>Currently, I'm reading his book &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, which purports to be a translation of a story written by an Arabian scholar who gets caught up in an adventure with a group of Viking warriors.  It's a well written story, and I'm enjoying it a great deal.   </p>
<p>I find it amusing that the US book cover (pictured right) has to have a block-buster-sounding &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; as a catch-phrase.   </p>
