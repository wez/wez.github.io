<p>
  I'm a systems architect from England living in in Maryland, USA.
  I like to unwind from work with an occasional single malt and a
  good movie.  If I can't get my hands on those, I'll substitute
  bourbon, bad sci-fi or xbox 360.

  I'm married to Juliette and we have a son called Xander.  Juliette studies
  Tae Kwon Do, Haidong Gumdo and writing; Xander attends school and loves
  math and space.

I've recently started working at <a
  href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and prior to that I was 
responsible for ensuring that the architecture of
<a href="http://messagesystems.com">Message Systems</a>
software continued to meet the performance, scalability and flexibility demands
placed upon it by clientele such as Facebook,
<a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>,
<a href="http://match.com">Match.com</a> and
<a href="http://messagelabs.com">MessageLabs</a>.
