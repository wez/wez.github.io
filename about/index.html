<p>
  I'm a systems architect from England living in in Maryland, USA.
  I like to unwind from work with an occasional single malt and a
  good movie.  If I can't get my hands on those, I'll substitute
  bourbon, bad sci-fi or xbox 360.

  I'm married to Juliette and we have a son called Xander.  Juliette studies
  Tae Kwon Do, Haidong Gumdo and writing; Xander attends school and loves
  math and space.
