<p>For a while now, I've been receiving some spam "news" about investment opportunities.  A while back I consigned it to my junk mail folder and forgot about it.</p><p>I just now received a telephone call from a company in luxembourg asking me if I had received their "investor email newsletter".  I told them I had, and that I had been filing it as spam for a long time now.</p><p>Unperturbed (perhaps he is deaf?), this guy proceeds to ask me if this is something I am interested in.</p><p>Maybe I've just lost the energy to get angry with these people, so I politely said "no, I'm not interested I'm afraid".  Luckily for me he said thank you and hung up.</p><p>Maybe I should start bouncing spam with "550 No spam, and no telephone calls either" :-)</p>
