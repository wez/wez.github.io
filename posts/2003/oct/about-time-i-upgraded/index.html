<p>As development zoomed forwards on jBlog, the name changed to <a href="http://www.s9y.org">Serendipity</a> and now it is 0.3 releases down the road.</p><p>So, it's about time I upgraded, and at last, I have.</p><p>I've been waiting for a stable release for a little while, because I knew I didn't get that much time to spend on the blog, and I didn't want to have to play catch-up from a development release with no real point of reference.</p><p>This latest release feels much more solid than my old jBlog, doesn't look too dissimilar from my original style sheets, and is actually quite nice to use.</p><p>Good job <a href="http://s9y.org/Team">Serendipity Team</a>!
