<p>A few of my friends and associates may have heard me talk about the media server I've been running in my basement; I used to automatically transfer content from my tivo to a hard-disk in my basement so that I had more space for recordings on the tivo.&nbsp; Since most of the recordings that I want to keep are now available via <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a>, I haven't had much call to use it in the last 6 months.</p> <p>So, what is CouchShare?&nbsp; It's a UPnP server that can share content from folder to an XBox 360 on your network.</p> <p>It's written in PHP (and requires a tiny PHP extension to enable multicast support) and is written using the eventing framework that is part of the <a href="http://labs.omniti.com/trac/alexandria">Alexandria</a> codebase.</p> <p>I wrote the code back in 2007 and it has served me well for a couple of years; it felt like it was about time I got off my backside and shared it with the world.</p> <p>It is by no-means a polished bit of code; I think it's probably the sloppiest code I've written in quite some time, and it may well need a couple of tweaks to make an easier application out of it.</p> <p>So, have at it: I've put the code up on bitbucket and I welcome code and documentation contributions!</p> <p><a title="http://bitbucket.org/wez/couchshare/" href="http://bitbucket.org/wez/couchshare/">http://bitbucket.org/wez/couchshare/</a></p>
