<p>I'm usually no big fan of chain letters (it's the "or-else" part that I object to), but this current 7-things-tag going around is pretty benign, and I think it's a great way to get some insight into the people you're reading. Thanks to <a href="http://elizabethmariesmith.com/2009/01/seven-weird-things/" title="Dreaming of Dawn">Elizabeth Smith</a> for tagging me.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's some facts about me that you may not know:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I have 6 siblings: 1.5 brothers and 2 sisters.</li>

  <li>I used to live in Spain and crossed the border to Gibraltar twice daily getting to and from school.</li>

  <li>I taught myself 6502 machine code on the C64 when I was 10. 'C' had to wait until I finally got my own Amiga at the age of 17; by that time it was already obsolete, but I'd dreamed of it for so long. The biggest barrier for learning 'C' for me was the sheer quantity of bad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(Amiga)" title="Intuition on wikipedia">Intuition</a> code examples floating around on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Fish" title="Fred Fish on Wikipedia">Fish Disks</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminet" title="Aminet on wikipedia">Aminet</a>.</li>

  <li>I studied Electronic Systems Engineering at <a href="http://www.elec.york.ac.uk/index.html" title="Department of Electronics, The University of York">The University of York</a>, where I discovered my first Unix system (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIX" title="IRIX on wikipedia">IRIX</a>) and had to retake my first year exam as a result of spending too much time in the "<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/jargon/html/S/spod.html" title="Jargon file definition of Spod">Spod</a> Pit" (a room filled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Indigo" title="SGI Indigo">Indigo</a> workstations). In retrospect, that "inappropriate" use of time was instrumental in shaping my career.</li>

  <li>I once rolled into a 9 a.m. computer lab assessment with my partner wearing tuxedos after partying all night at a graduation ball. The lab supervisor said "let's assess you first, as you look like you've got places to go". (We aced that assessment; preparation was key).</li>

  <li>I've moved home on average about once every 2.5 years of my life, making my time in the USA one of the longer periods in one spot.</li>

  <li>I've been told that I have a distinctive look, which is probably largely due to my long hair. In the late 80's, early 90's, I used to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_top_haircut" title="Flat top haircut on wikipedia">flat top</a>. Then I discovered Guns'n'Roses and Metallica and haven't worn my hair short since.</li>
</ol>
