	Following through on user repos and SSH, I revised the ACL support
	in mtrack and added a permissions editor for the repo editing screen.
	When you create a repo, it defaults to granting you (the creator) full
	access and denying everybody else access (equivalent to a private repo
	in services like Github and Bitbucket).

	These permissions are respected by the SSH plumbing, so you can prevent
	checking in or out on a repo-by-repo basis.
</p>
<p>
	Another important change in the tip is that the "admin" role now
	magically short-circuits permission checks in a fashion similar to the
	root user on unix systems.  This is important because the permission
	editor opens things up for you to remove your own rights on a repo,
	and can effectively make it vanish... so you'll need a super user role
	to get those rights back!
