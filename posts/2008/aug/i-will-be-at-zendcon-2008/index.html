Busy times here mean that I'm leaving it a bit late to say this, but I'll be at ZendCon this year too.  I'll be giving the usual talk on PDO, but my main reason for attending this year is to sync up with other PHP folks and talk about where PHP is at and where it's going.

ZendCon has been consistently good, and I look forward to attending again this year... see you there?
