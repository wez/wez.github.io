I'm pleased to announce that I'll be speaking at OSCON again.  I have the pleasure of co-presenting an <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2722">Extending PHP tutorial session with Marcus Boerger</a>, giving a new talk entitled <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2995">Hot Chocolate: Creating Cocoa apps with PHP</a>, and the tried and true <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2990">PDO Talk</a>.
As always, I'm looking forward to catching up on what's going on outside of my usual stack of software, meeting up with friends and making a visit to my favourite restaurant.  I hope to see you there :-)
