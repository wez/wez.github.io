Thought you would be the man to pass them by. (1) Running PHP 5.2.6 on Windows 2003 Server with IIS 6 appears to crash when running simple COM commands from the command-line (i.e. php -f file.php). Running the same script via an HTTP request in a browser doesn&#039;t. The crash is caught in DEP; (2) I have yet to find a single example on the net of a call to a COM object via PHP5 that uses ByRef parameters. Would be nice to have a working example of this. I&#039;ll see if I can get details on the crash and post it as a PHP bug. Again - enjoyed your slide show.<\/p>","email":"www.orderofhpak.com","url":null}]
