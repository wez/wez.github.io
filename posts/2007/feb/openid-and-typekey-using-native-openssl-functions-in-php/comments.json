For instance, in my implementation, I have a helper that encodes information into the $returnURL (and signs it) so that I can validate the incoming request and protect against replay attacks.  The form that this takes depends on the way that my app works, and I can see that being different for different places, so I think that any canned solution should be in user-space to make it easy to customize.   <\/p>","email":"wez@netevil.org","url":"http:\/\/netevil.org"},{"i":"45ce18b5-742a-8446-5343-5ce18b52b578","d":"2007-02-10 19:10:45","u":"http:\/\/www.cdatazone.org\/","n":"Rob Richards","c":"<b>Library<\/b><br\/>\n<p>I have been asked the same thing about InfoCards as well, but my thoughts have been along the same lines as Wez. As these technologies are starting to be converge and stabilize a bit, does it make sense to at least have a single library providing some of the core functionality for these technologies? Now that they are talking about these leveraging each other, and adding more functionality, some of this is getting difficult to do in user space and cover all the various combinations that can be used.  <\/p>","email":"http:\/\/www.cdatazone.org\/","url":"http:\/\/www.cdatazone.org\/"}]
