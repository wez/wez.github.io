<p>I'll be heading out for Chicago in a little while to attend php|tek, where I'll be giving my &quot;pdo&quot; and &quot;mail&quot; (a.k.a: &quot;not pdo&quot;) talks.   </p>
<p>I should be getting in to the hotel sometime around 7:30pm local time.   </p>
<p>I've been really busy recently, so I haven't yet had a chance to figure out which other sessions I'll attend, but I do know that I'm really looking forward to re-sync'ing with everybody.   </p>
<p>We're recruiting again, and I'm looking for both C and PHP folks to join my team at <a href="http://omniti.com/">OmniTI</a>/<a href="http://messagesystems.com">MessageSystems</a>, so if you're going to be there and are interested, please make a point of finding me--I'd love to hear from you.   </p>
<p>See you there :)   </p>
