<p><img align="right" src="http://omniti.com/img/labs.gif" alt=""/> We've migrated our port of Solaris umem from SourceForge to <a href="http://labs.omniti.com/">OmniTI Labs</a>, and have finally gotten around to making a source release.   </p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://labs.omniti.com/trac/portableumem/">project page here</a>, which includes a link to the downloadable source.   </p>
<p>The tarball will build you libumem and libumem_malloc.  The latter version can be used as an LD_PRELOAD to replace malloc for a target process, which is useful for debugging.  The former is more useful when deliberately linked into an app that wants to take advantage of the slab allocator APIs directly.   </p>
<p>I'm interested to see if using this in PHP will lead to performance gains, but currently lack the time to do any benchmarking.  I doubt that performance will suddenly improve just by preloading libumem_malloc, but there might be a gain if the zend engine allocator were tied into libumem.   </p>
<p>Perhaps someone reading this blog entry does have the time to investigate and could post the results?   </p>
