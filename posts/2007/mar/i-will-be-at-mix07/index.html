<p>I've been invited to participate in a panel at <a href="http://visitmix.com/">Microsoft's MIX conference</a> this year.  The panel is entitled &quot;Can't ASP.NET and PHP just get along?&quot; and is to be a &quot;spirited but friendly&quot; discussion on PHP and ASP.net interop.   </p>
<p>For those folks clicking through from the MIX site, you might be wondering who I am and why I'm on the panel... I've been partly responsible for development of the PHP core and primarily responsible for a lot of the Windows specific portions of PHP.  I work for <a href="http://omniti.com/home">OmniTI</a>, a world respected internet technologies consultancy.   </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to MIX, partly because I've heard that it's a lot of fun, and partly because it will a great opportunity to meet with a different crowd--the conferences that I usually attend have attendees that are largely LAMP focused, so the Windows platform focus will be an interesting change.  I'm hoping to gain some insight into what people perceive as short-comings in PHP on Windows, and feeding those back into PHP.   </p>
<p>If you see me there, stop me and say hi!  </p>
