<p>I've been meaning to blog about this for a while, but haven't found the time until now.   </p>
<p><a href="http://php.meetup.com/372/">This Monday 5th March, join us for the Columbia PHP Meetup</a>.   </p>
<p>OmniTI are providing the venue, PHP experts and pizza.  This first meetup will have a number of lightning talks and provide the opportunity to exchange ideas and talk about code, architecture, innovation, and open source in general. Anyone interested in PHP is welcome!   </p>
<p>Please RSVP via the <a href="http://php.meetup.com/372/">meetup link</a>.  </p>
