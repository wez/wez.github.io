I am very excited about this project of yours...<\/p>\n<p>I am a big Cocoa fan and have written a PHP framework roughly based on the Cocoa architecture called PHOCOA (http:\/\/phocoa.com). I have been waiting for this project for a long time!<\/p>\n<p>I have written a Mac OS X app called &quot;PHOCOA Builder&quot; that is the analog of Interface Builder. Right now though I have to use some cheap tricks to share data across the 2 platforms. There&#039;s lots of metadata in the PHP side that would be *great* if only I could access it from the Cocoa side. Right now I just have some PHP scripts that dump things out in XML and then the Mac app reads them, but this will be much cleaner.<\/p>\n<p>I will definitely be giving this a try sometime soon.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks!<\/p>","email":"Alan Pinstein","url":null,"did":"51533954"},{"i":"c72e6f81-6cd0-41ca-a6e4-067d0808261f","d":"2007-11-04 20:18:57","u":"http:\/\/solsys.myopenid.com","n":"Josh K.","c":"<b>Nifty<\/b><br\/>\n<p>Looks nifty, I was starting to get jealous of the Python and Ruby guys since they have this built-in to Leopard now :-)<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Leopard goodies, you mentioned a couple years ago working on a DTrace extension for PHP.
