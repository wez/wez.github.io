<p>I uploaded release 0.9.0 of <a href="http://evildesk.wezfurlong.org/">EvilDesk</a> tonight.  I realized that I hadn't made a release in over a year, so I tidied up a few bits and pieces and uploaded it.  Feel free to <a href="http://evildesk.wezfurlong.org/changelog.php">review the changelog</a> if you're curious.   </p>
<p>Highlights include an improved dock style toolbar, a launcher plugin (type the name of a program or document to find it and run it, instead of poking around the start menu), simpler configuration of the toolbar positioning, translations for German and French, less bugs and support for 64-bit Windows.   </p>
<p>Enjoy!  </p>
