<p>I'm excited for OSCON, so much so that I don't mind my 5am start tomorrow.  I'm in good spirits; we reached a big milestone at work a week or so ago and I've had a couple of days vacation, so I'm feeling rested and receptive for what I think is the best OpenSource conference out there.
</p><p>As I mentioned in an earlier post, I'll be co-hosting a tutorial on extending/embedding PHP with Marcus Boerger bright and early on the Monday.  If you're planning on attending, I <em>strongly </em>recommend pre-caffeinating yourselves as it will be an intense 3 hours!  You can also see me doing my usual PDO talk (when people stop asking me to give it, I'll stop giving it!) on the Thursday.
</p><p>Aside from getting together with the usual crowd again, I'm hoping to make some new friends.  I'm also looking forward to some fun social events around the conference, and particularly looking forward to visiting my favourite restaurant in the whole world (I'm not going to tell you what it is until after I've been thereâ€”it's mine, all mine!).
</p><p>After the conference I'm bouncing up to Seattle for a Sushi-and-Xbox-360-on-120-inch-screen party with friends and colleagues from OmniTI.  And after that, I'm bouncing down to San Jose for a couple of days before red-eyeing it back to the office.
</p><p>A busy schedule ahead, and just over a week away from home; I think it's going to be a good combination of fun, busy, tiring and restful all at the same time.
</p><p>If you see me there, stop me and say hi!</p>
