</p><p>I'm co-hosting a mega tutorial session on Extending PHP with Marcus Boerger and Sara Golemon (this time, we three really are all there!), and giving my talking on best mailing practices for PHP.
</p><p>That's right, no PDO talk this time around; it will make a nice change for me (not that I don't like giving that talk, it's just that I've given it so many times over the last couple of years!).
</p><p>I like ZendCon; it has a good balance between business and dev.  If you can persuade your boss, or you are the boss, you could do worse than book yourself into the conference.</p>
