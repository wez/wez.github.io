<p><img align="right" src="http://netevil.org/uploads/dr.evil.sil.gif.t" alt="Dr Evil"/>For a long time now, I've wanted to do this; build up a fairly simple (yet powerful) Blog/Wiki/CVS/Bugs/Shopping-list/whatever manager.  I was going to try to use <a href="http://s9y.org">Serendipity</a> as the base for this system, but when I sat down to do so, I discovered that s9y has gotten a bit too large for my purposes.   </p>
<p>So, here we have a totally new system, hand coded by yours-truly and running from an sqlite database.  So far it's a Blog/Wiki, but support for other more useful tools will be forthcoming.   </p>
<p><b>Err, but why is it an Evil Blog?</b>   </p>
<p>I was fishing around for a new domain name, in anticipation of a change in employment sometime this year, and I found this one and thought it sounded cool.  So, in the spirit of thinking up a cool name and then trying to justify it, my gimmick is this:   </p>
<p>I'm motivated by power, so I'm always seeking to make things better, more functional, or even just getting them so that they work.  If I had as much uninterrupted time as I needed to finish everything, I could take over the 'Net/world.   </p>
<p>Sadly, I don't have that time, so my attempts are on a par with a certain Dr. Evil--both in terms of execution and effect. Yes, it's a pretty lame link, but I like it.   </p>
