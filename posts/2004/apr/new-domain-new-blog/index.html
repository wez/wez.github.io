<p>I'm gradually moving things over to my <a href="http://wezfurlong.org/blog/2004/apr/an-evil-blog">new domain and new blog</a>.  This one will still hang around to keep links working; eventually I'll move the content over and set up redirects so that I don't need to keep two separate things up and running.</p><p>The new blog is something I put together myself without really reading any blogging specs, so it might have a few teething troubles, althought it's not doing anything too complex.</p>
