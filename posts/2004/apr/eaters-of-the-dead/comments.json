It's not the greatest adaptation (the Andromeda Strain was probably the best adaptation of any of his books, seconded perhaps by The Terminal Man), but it's still fun.  Especially if you have it in you to enjoy Antonio Banderas.   <\/p>\n<p>And yes, I'm a Crichton freak too.  Read Sphere (that's perhaps the worst of the movies and a pretty good book).  <\/p>","email":"http:\/\/www.schlossnagle.org\/~george\/blog\/","url":"http:\/\/www.schlossnagle.org\/~george\/blog\/"},{"i":"fed286d9-4154-44cf-8587-c7df79ffa9f1","d":"2004-04-29 23:45:54","u":"http:\/\/imajes.info\/","n":"James Cox","c":"<p>I'll second what George said - the reason why they chose 13th warrior was because it was felt (probably by the fcc) that &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; was too graphic and upsetting. &lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;I prefer Airframe, and i can't wait till that's made into a film. Prey is a great story, as is Timeline (the film totally sucks though).  <\/p>","email":"http:\/\/imajes.info\/","url":"http:\/\/imajes.info\/"},{"i":"ff58c6d6-ab46-4430-9522-c0897d273dfd","d":"2004-04-30 15:10:49","u":"http:\/\/netevil.org\/","n":"wezfurlong","c":"<p>I should have known that it was a film title.  Maybe we will rent a copy, although I'm a bit sceptical of Hamtonio Banderas ;)   <\/p>\n<p>We thought that Timeline was the the worst film so far.  I've seen Sphere but not read it--judging by how bad the film was, I'd say the book must be pretty good.
