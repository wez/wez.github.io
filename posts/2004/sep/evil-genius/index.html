<p>Looks like I need invest in a copy of <a href="http://www.howevilareyou.com/">Evil Genius</a> by Vivendi Universal Games.   </p>
<p>By a quirk of timing, this coincides with me adding the evil photograph taken of me by my evil assistant during my evil vacation on my evil moonbase (see evil box-out to the right on my evil blog).  </p>
