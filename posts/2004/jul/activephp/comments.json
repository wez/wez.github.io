It doesnt function properly. Perhaps the word 'fault' was what threw you off, but nothing was intended negatively. Additionally, theres absolutely nothing wrong with instructing users and PHP enthusiasts to email you requesting the fix. A request is just that, something which one would like to see done, but doesnt nessesarily mean it will be so. And if you count the number of times that I had emailed you since last January, including all email addresses which you happen to have, they do total 6.   <\/p>\n<p>RE: Contributing. Its not good practice to make false claims against someone's character either. I had contributed to the geoShell (http:\/\/geoshell.com) project for nearly 4 years before stepping down. Shame on you.   <\/p>\n<p>RE: It working with PHP4 and the Windows Script Control. It didnt. Never did. The web is littered with forum posts from frustrated programmers trying to get it to work.   <\/p>\n<p>I also appreciate (really, i do!) the follow up reccomending that I not implement this do to the threading issue.   <\/p>\n<p>That being said, I think your post is a little off base, as I made every attempt to be polite and respectful of both the man and the coding. Again, I apologize that you took any offense, but you must realize that my attempts at contacting you were nothing more than a frustrated developer seeking what he was doing wrong, against a claim which accompanied what you had written - that, in fact, it was supposed to work.   <\/p>\n<p>Take Care, Andrew Powell  <\/p>","email":"andrew@shellscape.org","url":null,"did":"51534929"},{"i":"0e3070be-8d51-43cb-b8e6-2a94fe24f64d","d":"2004-07-23 10:38:38","u":"http:\/\/netevil.org\/","n":"wezfurlong","c":"<b>YMMV<\/b><br\/>\n<p>I made no claims beyond YMMV (http:\/\/www.faqs.org\/docs\/jargon\/Y\/YMMV.html) (read the email I sent to you again).   <\/p>\n<p>Making assertions about what I did or did not do is pretty dumb: you weren't here.
