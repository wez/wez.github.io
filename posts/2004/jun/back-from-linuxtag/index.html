<p>After a surprisingly long day of travel (each leg of the journey isn't that long, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts), I'm back home in England.   </p>
<p>I did't take any photos this year, but if you're curious, <a href="http://www.schlitt.info/applications/blog/index.php?/archives/221_Linuxtag_-_My_photos_complete.html">Tobias has rounded up a whole bunch</a>.   </p>
<p>I'd like to thank <a href="http://think-php.de">ThinkPHP</a> for sponsoring my journey and stay at LinuxTag again this year; the critical mass of PHP brains at a conference usually results in something new for PHP, and it is good that ThinkPHP recognize and help this to happen.   </p>
<p>So what's coming out of LinuxTag?  We had a database meeting again this year; last year it spawned PDO, and this year we (most of the major PHP database extension maintainers) sat down and refined some aspects of it.  Other cool stuff is hinted at <a href="http://blog.coggeshall.org/archives/123_Back_from_Germany.html">here</a>, and will be very useful if used wisely.  </p>
