<p>I will be giving a talk on <a href="http://pecl.php.net">PECL</a> in the <a href="http://lamparea.de/index_ndim11.php">LAMP Area</a> at <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org">LinuxTag</a> this month.  The talk will focus on why PECL is good for both users and developers.  If you're interested in that, please come along.   </p>
<p>I will be there all week, so there should be plenty of time to discuss cool things in PHP and/or hassle me to finish up one of the numerous things that I've started since the last conference run.   </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to it: LinuxTag is easily the best conference in Europe (in my experience)--plenty of things to look at, in a good location, and with excellent company.   </p>
<p>Hopefully there will be an alternative to Jolt Cola this year...  </p>
