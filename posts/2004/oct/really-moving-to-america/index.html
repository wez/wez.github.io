<p>A little while back I mentioned that I was <a href="http://wezfurlong.org/blog/2004/sep/moving-to-usa-its-official">Moving to America</a>.  It's taken from then until a few days ago to get the magic visa sticker attached to my passport, and now we are finally good to go.   </p>
<p>The people shipping our stuff have been here since 9:30am and are just finishing up (it's getting close to 3pm now).  I've moved a number of times in the past but this is the first time I've had someone else do the packing for me--I can't stress how much easier it is this way.  If I hadn't been up all night sorting stuff into ship and skip piles, I would be feeling pretty good right about now.   </p>
<p>Why was I up all night the night before?  The answer is that it is impossible to get anything done during the day with Xander running around and, let's face it, no one really wants to pull an all-nighter when it's not essential.   </p>
<p>We'll be spending the next couple of days getting rid of the stuff we didn't decide to take with us, and making the house look nice (we still need to sell it!).   </p>
<p>We fly on the 29th.   </p>
