I also came to America. I wish you the best in your new stage of your life. Once again America wins your talent and your home country losses.   <\/p>\n<p>My 2 cents of advice. Where you go in America is very important. Plan carefully where your new base will be. You cannot do all by yourself no matter how gifted you are. So you need a reachable support system.   <\/p>\n<p>In case you wonder, I live in Seattle, and am just starting to work for Microsoft. Yes, I love Linux as well. My phone is +1 (425)775-7475   <\/p>\n<p>Have a wonderful discovery of America!   <\/p>\n<p>George   <\/p>","email":"georgeb@brd.com\/George","url":null,"did":"51534803"}]
