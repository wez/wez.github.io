<p>I just sat down with Juliette to play a two-player game of <a href="http://www.ascaron.com/gb/gb_sacred/">Sacred</a>, a game that I got a little while back, but never found the time to finish.   </p>
<p>Sacred looks lovely and is a fun game, when it's not crashing out.  It's one of the least stable games I've laid eyes upon (even with the latest patches) since I had the misfortune to install the first Star Trek: Armada game.  </p>
