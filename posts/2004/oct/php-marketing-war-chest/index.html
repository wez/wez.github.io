<p>Marco aims to publish a number of case studies on the adoption of PHP in small, medium, and large businesses (or enterprise, if you will) with the intention of creating a kind of marketing &quot;war chest&quot;.  The idea is to form a kind of business PHP hub that will help other businesses to make a more informed decision when it comes to adopting PHP.   </p>
<p>Marco is looking for people to write case studies in marketing-speak to use there; for more information, <a href="http://blogs.phparch.com/mt/index.php?p=30">read Marco's blog entry</a>.  </p>
