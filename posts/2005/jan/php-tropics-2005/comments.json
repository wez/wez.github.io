The last time I presented, I focused on using Unified ODBC; this time around, I'll probably cover PDO_ODBC (the IBM DB2 flavour) and a smattering of Unified ODBC. Hey, we've only got an hour and a half, so I'll probably throw in all kinds of extra take-home material too.   <\/p>\n<p>So if you want to learn how to program PHP 5 applications with DB2, Derby, or Cloudscape, check out Wez's presentation to learn all about PDO, then stick around to learn how all of that good stuff applies to my favourite databases. It's a devastating one-two combo :)   <\/p>\n<p>(BTW, I also wrote the first draft of the PDO documentation, and used the experience to create a presentation on writing documentation for PHP extensions -- so if you're interested in helping out the PHP project, and you're a good writer, my presentation on Writing PHP Documentation near the end of the conference is for you).  <\/p>","email":"http:\/\/www.coffeecode.net\/","url":"http:\/\/www.coffeecode.net\/","did":"51534752"}]
