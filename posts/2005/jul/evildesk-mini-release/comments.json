I would like to say I like this program very much. It's using so little resources and is still looking very nice! Two questions though:   <\/p>\n<p>1. When using Alt-tab to navigate open tasks, I noticed that Explorer windows have no icon associated. It's no big deal, but still perhaps some little thing for a next update.   <\/p>\n<p>2.
