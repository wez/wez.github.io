<p>[Update: <a href="/blog/2005/jul/evildesk-release-4">Release 4 is out</a>]   </p>
<p>I've updated my EvilDesk and included the user-definable context menu code I mentioned in the comments of my last post.   </p>
<p>I've also created a <a href="http://evildesk.wezfurlong.org">new home</a> for the project, so that I can group the docs together more easily.   </p>
<p>I will continue to publish news about updates here on my blog, so if you're already subscribed here, you needn't do anything more to keep up to date on this project.  </p>
