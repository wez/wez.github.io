<p>It's the weekend, time for relaxation and recreational hacking. The perfect opportunity to give PDO a whirl :-)   </p>
<p>Please <b>do</b> try it out soon as you can; with PHP 5.1 beta due on the first of March, it's really important to make sure that we don't have any &quot;brown-paper-bag&quot; bugs sooner rather than later.   </p>
<p>If you pass up on this round of testing, and then you find a bug in PDO in PHP 5.1, it's your fault. :-)   </p>
<p>Let's try to make 5.1 as &quot;gold&quot; as we can!  </p>
