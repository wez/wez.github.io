<p>I've redirected my feeds via <a href="http://feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> so that I can get some idea of how many people are reading this stuff.  If this causes some burps and &quot;re-runs&quot; of my earlier posting in the various aggregators out there, I apologize.   </p>
<p>I've also added a limit on the number of items that wind up in my feed, so you won't have to fetch my entire blog history when polling for new articles.   </p>
<p>The feedburner migration should be transparent; no action should be required by subscribers; the URL is the same.  </p>
