<p>You may remember that Oracle Magazine were asking for nominations to honour people that have worked in some Oracle-related facility over the past year.  Someone nominated me for the &quot;PHP Developer of the year&quot; category, and I &quot;won&quot; the award.   </p>
<p>I'm normally a bit sceptical of awards because they're somewhat arbitrary and tend to be rather intangible, however, Oracle Magazine have gone the whole nine yards to counter that intangibility aspect;  I received this weighty chunk of glass as the physical manifestation of the award:   </p>

<p>I suspect that I won the award as a result of my efforts in developing PDO, the PDO OCI driver and my role in the redesign of the oci8 extension.  Antony Dovgal has put in a similar amount of effort (perhaps even more) in his work on Oracle support in PHP.  As far as I'm concerned, Tony, both our names are on the award :)   </p>
<p>If you're really interested, you can read <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/05-nov/o65awards.html#furlong">the blurb from the magazine here</a>; paraphrasing-for-print has slightly twisted my words, but it's more or less what I said.   </p>
<p>Some observations about that chunk of glass: <ul>
<li>it's difficult to photograph
 <li>it's invisible on my white mantelpiece
 <li>it's waaay too easy to get finger and palm prints all over it
   </ul>
