<p>With the release of PHP 5.1 stable, it's time to mark PDO as stable too.  I've pushed the first batch of stable PDO extensions out to PECL.   </p>
<p>Now that PDO 1.0 is out the door, we can start looking at new features. I've put together a preliminary list of things, which can be found <a href="http://viewcvs.php.net/viewcvs.cgi/php-src/ext/pdo/TODO?rev=1.6.2.2">on the tip of the 5.1 branch</a>.   </p>
<p>Reasonable suggestions for additions to this list are welcomed.  I'm not sure that everything on that list will make it into PDO 1.1, because I'd like to keep the development cycle shorter, rather than longer.  There's always PDO 1.2 to think of, after all.   </p>
<p>Happy PDO'ing!  </p>
