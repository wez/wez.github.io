<p>I'm very dissappointed to see that my (perfectly reasonably) comments have not been &quot;accepted&quot; on a certain blog where a technical discussion has been taking place.   </p>
<p>At first I thought it was just because the blog owner was offline for the night, but now I see that someone elses comments, posted after mine, have appeared.   </p>
<p>I'd taken a low-key approach (by not responding to each comment with an entry on my blog) on this &quot;blog conversation&quot; because I don't particularly like to &quot;do my laundry in public&quot;   </p>
<p>The sad fact is that I won't trust moderated blogs to be fair or honest again in the future.  </p>
