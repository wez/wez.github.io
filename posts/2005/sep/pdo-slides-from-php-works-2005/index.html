<p>You can find the slides from <a href="http://netevil.org/talks/PHP-Data-Objects.pdf">PDO talk here</a>.   </p>
<p>While I'm here talking about PDO, I wanted to give you a heads up. PDO 1.0RC2 will move from PDO_XXX style constants to using class based constants like PDO::XXX.  The reason for this change is that it will fit in with namespace support in PHP when it is implemented.   </p>
<p>Yes, this should have been changed <b>before</b> 1.0RC1, but we only just talked about it over the last couple of days.  Sorry.   </p>
<p>This change has not yet been made, I'm just letting you know in advance; we'll be pushing out a release with this change over the next week, after making sure we're not going to make another change like this.   </p>
