I seem to have more of an issue with the manner in which the announcements are made, rather than the announcements being made.  I think the 'manner' is juvenile.  Not the effort, which to date has proven to be correct in every effort.  But there seems to always be added comments about how 'unacceptable' something is.  I think that is where one needs to analyze their motives.   <\/p>\n<p>I didn't say Stefan's name because I think I was speaking to a priciple rather than a personality.  I used Wordpress because it was the most recent and obvious instance of this type of behavior, but as I stated earlier, I have likely been guilty of it as well.  I just think it has the right intention in some ways, but is a equally disingenuous.  <\/p>","email":"Marcus Whitney","url":null},{"i":"42ff8237-3852-0847-8912-2ff8237a651e","d":"2005-08-14 17:41:11","u":"http:\/\/pooteeweet.org\/","n":"Lukas","c":"<p>+1 on your post Wez.   <\/p>\n<p>As for the tone .. its a common challenge that people fail on. I personally have taken the approach to always read things with good intention. After a while you know the people that sound rude, but still manage to give you good content.   <\/p>\n<p>BTW: you do not have to read these posts either. Just like open source they are yours to read or ignore with no warrenty that they will be pleasent ..  <\/p>","email":"http:\/\/pooteeweet.org\/","url":"http:\/\/pooteeweet.org\/"},{"i":"430982e1-26ee-5294-7370-30982e1350a1","d":"2005-08-22 07:46:41","u":"anon","n":"Paul","c":"<b>vjj<\/b><br\/>\n<p>Nice blog.I like this. &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.sify.com&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;\/a&gt; http:\/\/www.sify.com  <\/p>","email":"Paul","url":null}]
