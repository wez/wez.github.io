<p>Well, if you haven't tried it already, and you're interested in PDO, don't: just grab the latest snapshot from <a href="http://snaps.php.net">snaps</a> instead.   </p>
<p>Lack of communication, and perhaps some politics, meant that 5.1beta shipped with a stupid bug in the PDO core extension, causing a infinite loop on request shutdown.   </p>
<p>I'm somewhat annoyed at this, because it's a showstopper that we could and <b>should</b> have caught before announcing the beta.   </p>
<p>Oh well, such is life.   </p>
<p>I'm just getting stuck into packing things up ready to move into our first home in the USA (we've been living in an apartment for a few months), so I'm not going to let it bother me.   </p>
<p>Have a good weekend.   </p>
