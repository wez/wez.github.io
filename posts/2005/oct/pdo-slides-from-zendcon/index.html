<p>(hmm, I could have sworn I posted these the other day; maybe the wifi cut out just as I hit &quot;save&quot;)   </p>
<p>You can find the slides from the <a href="/images/PHP-Data-Objects.pdf">PDO talk here</a>.   </p>
<p>While I'm here talking about PDO, I wanted to give you a heads up. PDO 1.0RC2 will move from PDO_XXX style constants to using class based constants like PDO::XXX.  The reason for this change is that it will fit in with namespace support in PHP when it is implemented.   </p>
<p>Yes, this should have been changed <b>before</b> 1.0RC1: Sorry.   </p>
<p>This change has not yet been made to the packages available via PECL, but <b>is</b> present in the PHP 5.1 branch--including PHP 5.1RC3.   </p>
<p>[yes, this text is pretty much a rip off an earlier blog entry I made]  </p>
