<p>Comcast has had really crappy internet connectivity tonight, which has made it frustrating to try to get any hacking done--surprising how many projects I have simmering right now that need to access the 'net.   </p>
<p>While I'm here, I'll post this rather amusing link to <a href="http://geekfantasies.com/">geekfantasies.com</a>; I saw it mentioned on TV the other night but the site was down (bandwidth limit exceeded!).   </p>
