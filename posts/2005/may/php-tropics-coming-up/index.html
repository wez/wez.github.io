<p><img align="right" src="/images/tropics_logo.gif.t" alt="tropics_logo"/> I'm making some final preparations this weekend for my first journey to Mexico and the <a href="http://www.phparch.com/tropics/">PHP|Tropics</a> conference.   </p>
<p>I'll be speaking on two topics: PDO (of course) and something of an odd-ball talk on PHP's Streams--basically a collection of various handy code snippets and best/worst practices for using streams.   </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the trip; I'll have my electrovaya fully charged for some plane hacking, and be accompanied by my friend, colleague and boss <a href="http://www.schlossnagle.org/~george/blog/">George Schlossnagle</a>--it should be a lot of fun meeting up with the PHP gang again, as well as meeting with the attendees: it's always good meet people that are seriously using PHP.   </p>
<p>The location is also going to be nice ;-)   </p>
<p>Hope to see you there :)   </p>
