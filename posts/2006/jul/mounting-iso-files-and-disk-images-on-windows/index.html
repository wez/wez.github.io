<p>The folks over at <a href="http://osronline.com">OSR Online</a> have a handy, no-nonsense and free (as in beer) driver and configuration utility that allows you to mount disk, floppy and ISO images under Windows.   </p>
<p>You have to register to get at their downloads, and in return you get a very occasional email as well as a periodic printed &quot;magazine&quot; containing low level windows kernel coding information.   </p>
<p>You can find the download at <a href="http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=410">OsrVirtualCdAndDisk</a>; it works like a charm for me.  </p>
