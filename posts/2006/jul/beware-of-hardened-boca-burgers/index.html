<p>I enjoy eating at <a href="http://redrobin.com">Red Robin</a>; they have a delicious menu, and you can substitute <a href="http://www.gardenburger.com/">Gardenburger</a> or <a href="http://www.bocaburger.com/">Boca burger</a> patties if you're of a vegetarian persuasion.   </p>
<p>I've had a consistently good experience with RR since we moved to the USA, but over the last couple of months the boca burgers have been a bit tough at the Columbia location.   </p>
<p>The last one I ordered did <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauraxthomson/188274151/">this</a> to my fork.  Ow!   </p>
