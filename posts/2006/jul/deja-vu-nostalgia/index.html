<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see this picture on <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/back-on-duty.html">Henri Berguis' blog</a> just now:   </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that this is within a couple of hundred yards of the apartment block that I lived in about 18 years ago in La-Linea, Spain.   </p>
<p>Back then, those seats on the waterfront were poorly maintained white-washed concrete blocks, some of which had fallen down towards the coast.  The other side of those blocks used to be a rocky slope leading down to the water.   </p>
<p>If you followed the road closer to the Gibraltar border, you could park your car on the road side and a group of gypsies would &quot;look after&quot; your car in exchange for a small fee (typically pocket change, if I remember correctly).  If you felt that their protection wasn't worth much, you'd return to find that someone had indeed broken into your car and removed any valuables.  I wonder if they're still protecting cars to this day?   </p>
