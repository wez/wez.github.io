<p>Tomorrow afternoon I begin my 3-hop flight, via my favorite airport (Phoenix... I got stuck there on my last visit to the west coast) to attend <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON</a>.  I'm giving my tried-and-true PDO talk again this year (yeah, yeah, but I have new material for <a href="http://www.phparch.com/phpworks/">php|works</a>).   </p>
<p>As usual, I'm looking forward to the gathering of OpenSource folks for drinking^Wbrainstorming sessions, and the opportunity to be subjected to cross-polination from non-PHP projects.   </p>
<p>See you there?  </p>
