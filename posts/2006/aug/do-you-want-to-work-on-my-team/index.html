<p>In addition to the <a href="http://laurat.blogs.com/random_ramblings/2006/08/more_jobs_omnit.html">PHP web dev openings that Laura mentioned</a>, <a href="http://omniti.com/">we're</a> also looking to hire some <a href="http://omniti.com/people/jobs#midsyseng">mid-level systems engineers</a> to code primarily in C on UNIX/Windows.   </p>
<p>If you're interested in working directly with George, Theo and myself (and the veritable host of other smart, interesting and fun people that also work at OmniTI) on some of the fastest, most highly stressed core infrastructure applications ever created, then we'd like to hear from you.   </p>
<p>If you're looking to work hard, learn a lot and have a lot of fun while doing both of these things, then please look over the <a href="http://omniti.com/people/jobs#midsyseng">job description</a> and send your applications to jobs@omniti.com.   </p>
