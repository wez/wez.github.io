<p>It looks like running the yahoo music engine app on win64 isn't officially supported, but here's how I got it to work.   </p>
<p><ul>
<li>download the installer
 <li>right click on the ymjsetup.exe and choose the compatibility tab and set the installer to run in compatibility mode for Windows XP.
 <li>make sure that you've run windows media player at least once
 <li>run ymjsetup.exe
 <li>ignore any error messages that might pop-up; let the installation continue
 <li>reboot
   </ul>
<p>and that should be it.  </p>
