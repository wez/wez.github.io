<p>According to the manual for my RAZR, there should be a Sync option on the connection menu next to the bluetooth setup; its purpose is to configure the settings for a SyncML server.  It isn't present on my t-mobile provided handset, and t-mobile support has no idea about it.   </p>
<p>I've tried googling around, but it seems that no one else has any suggestions on how to enable that feature.  I suspect that I'd need to re-flash the handset to turn it on, which is something I'd rather not do.   </p>
<p>Anyone out there have any advice on this?   </p>
