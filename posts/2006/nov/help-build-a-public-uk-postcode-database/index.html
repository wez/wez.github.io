<p><i> New Public Edition maps are trying to create a freely usable UK postcode database. The British Post Office owns the database of postcodes and their corresponding coordinates. That means that your website can only use post-codes if you buy a license from the Post Office. </i>  </p>
<p><i> New Public Edition (along with a similar project, <a href="http://www.freethepostcode.org/">Free the Postcode</a>) is trying to solve this. They have 1950s-era public-domain maps and they ask you to locate your house (or childhood home) on it and key in your post-code. They do the rest, eventually building out a complete database of every postcode in Britain. </i>  </p>
<p><i> The resulting data will be released as purely public domain--no restrictions whatsoever on re-use. </i>  </p>
<p>I just filled in a couple of postcodes from previous residences, and it was quite interesting to see how the area that I grew up in has changed since 1950; it looks like it used to be one large farm that was broken up into a couple of smaller farms that have now become residential areas.  It's a logical progression really, but having a date like 1950 gives a sense of dimension--it's easy to think that that change happened &quot;hundreds of years ago&quot;, but it's much more recent than that.   </p>
<p>So, if you're in the UK, or lived there for a while, please take a couple of minutes to visit <a href="http://www.npemap.org.uk/">New Public Edition</a>, fill in your postcode, and perhaps gain a better understanding of the places you've lived.  </p>
