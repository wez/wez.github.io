<p>I've had an incredibly busy year so far, having spent the better part of half of it on-site with a customer/partner across the atlantic, and it's only March.  In addition to working with them on a large scale deployment proof-of-concept project (I'll blog more about that when I'm sure it's ok to blog about it), we've been hard at work on our Ecelerity 2.1 release, which is just about out-the-door (just some final QA to go).   </p>
<p>One of the internals features in our new release is the adoption of the Solaris slab memory allocator, libumem.  We already had our own slab allocator, but there are some interesting innovations in libumem that reduce lock contention and cache invalidations that make it attractive for a very high performance multi-threaded application like Ecelerity.   </p>
<p>Since Solaris is <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSourced</a> under the CDDL, we were able to incorporate the allocator into Ecelerity and port it to Linux and Windows and not be forced to open-up our entire source-code.   The CDDL requires that we publish the code that we modified, so we set up a project on SourceForge.  The code isn't out-of-the-box usable just yet, as it lacks its own configure script and makefile, but it won't take much effort to create those.   </p>
<p>Thanks Sun for opening up such good quality code under a commercial software friendly license!   </p>
