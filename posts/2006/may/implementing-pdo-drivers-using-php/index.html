<p>An interesting development that sprang from a conversation I had with Sara Golemon at the Zend Conference last year: <a href="http://blog.libssh2.org/index.php?/archives/18-PDO_User-and-the-effects-of-Slide-Driven-Development.html">user-space PDO drivers</a>.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's the ability to be able to define classes in PHP that implement PDO drivers.   </p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what people make of this.  I was chatting about it with <a href="http://shiflett.org">Chris</a> last night, and he suggested that it might serve as a useful bridge for systems that have no native library connectivity.  PDO::User could be used to shoe-horn in connectivity without having to radically rewrite other application code. Another similar idea is to map older database extensions as PDO drivers.   </p>
<p>It's still early days yet, but it will be interesting to see where this goes.  Thanks Sara :)  </p>
