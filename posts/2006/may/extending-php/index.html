<p>While poking around the disks in my linux box, I found my materials for a session on extending PHP that I originally gave as a 3 hour tutorial at PHP{Con West 2003.   </p>
<p>Sadly, I seem to have lost the working C code (libares bindings for PHP), but all the relevant parts can be found in the comprehensive PDF I made from the slides: <a href="http://www.php.net/~wez/extending-php.pdf">Extending PHP Slides</a> (PDF).  The content is based on PHP 4, but should still be applicable to PHP 5.   </p>
<p>As it happens, Mike Wallner has recently built his own <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/ares/">PECL extension for libares</a>, which is much more complete (and complex) than my examples.  </p>
