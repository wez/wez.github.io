I'm allways interested in your opinion. You're a PHP guy who's opinions come from REAL WORLD work as opposed to press rhetoric :)   <\/p>\n<p>Opinion is great - but arguments that are ALL opnion hurt everyone.   <\/p>\n<p>When PHP is the right choice for an application - or when ASP.NET is the right choice - the customer is only served by making the decision based on &quot;information&quot; instead of emotion.   <\/p>\n<p>The part that really tickles me is that you have as much as anyone in the PHP community to make Windows OS functionality available to Developers who use the Windows platformwith all your work on PHP bridging technology.   <\/p>\n<p>Now - if I can just get someone to port PHP-Nuke and WordPress to SQL 2005 :)   <\/p>\n<p>Take care - see you at Zend Con !
