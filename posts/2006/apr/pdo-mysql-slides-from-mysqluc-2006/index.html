<p>I tried to upload my slides from the conference, but run into problems with a firewall somewhere, so they've had to wait for me to return home.   </p>
<p>So, here we are: <a href="/images/pdo-mysql.pdf">Using MySQL with PDO</a> (PDF).   </p>
<p>This was my first MySQL users conference, and it seemed to go well.  Truth be told, I'm not a database fanatic (which is ironic considering my involvement with PDO), so I didn't find a lot of the material to my taste.  I did learn a few things from Jim Winsteads embedded mysql talk (something I bet he'll be surprised to hear :) and also Hartmut Holzgraefe's mysqli talk.  I also got to chat to Monty about <a href="/blog/2006/apr/using-pdo-mysql">the issues I mentioned</a> and meet some new faces, including <a href="http://evilsysadmin.blogspot.com/">my Evil sysadmin</a>, some old and some older faces (Hi Sterling :)   </p>
<p>The conference was quite big; 1500 attendees, 6 tech tracks (there were a couple of other non-tech tracks too, but I forget exactly what they covered) and a lot of BOF sessions.  If MySQL is your bread and butter, you might want to consider attending the next one.  </p>
