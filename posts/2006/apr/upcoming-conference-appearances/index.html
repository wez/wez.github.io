<p>I'll be giving my &quot;usual&quot; PDO talk at both <a href="http://www.mysqluc.com/">MySQL Users Conference 2006</a> and <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON 2006</a> (the MySQLUC version  of the talk will have a MySQL focus).   </p>
<p>If you're interested in PDO and haven't had the opportunity to see me give this talk yet, please consider trying to get to one of these conferences.  My talk covers the design decisions behind PDO, suggests some best practices for using it, highlights portability concerns (particularly because PHP programmers have been &quot;dummied down&quot; by the older mysql client library API) and more.   </p>
<p>As usual, I'm always open for questions during the talk (I'm there for your benefit after all) and I try to make myself more generally available during the conference, so if you want to ask me questions, or even just have a chat, then feel free to approach me.   </p>
