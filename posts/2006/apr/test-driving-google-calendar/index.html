<p>Well, I guess I feel similarly to <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/625955.html">JWZ</a> when it comes to calendar software.  Yesterday I downloaded the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning.html">Lightning 0.1</a> extension for Thunderbird.  It's a partial improvement over running Sunbird; it's handy to be able to view the calendar right there in thunderbird, but it clearly needs a lot more polish before it can be really used.   </p>
<p>I was all set to switch over to Lightning from Thunderbird, but then I read JWZ's entry that mentioned <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> at the bottom, and it looks good.   </p>
<p>The major points that appeal to me:   </p>
<p><ul>
<li>SMS notifications prior to events.  You don't have to be at your desk to get the reminder, or even to have your computer turned on.
 <li>It's online, accessible from anywhere that's connected to the 'net
 <li>Public events can be published as RSS and iCal (find mine in the geeky sidebar to the right)
 <li>The whole thing (including private events) can also be published as RSS and iCal
 <li>You can import existing calendar data from iCal and CSV files
 <li>UI is nice
   </ul>
<p>So, I think I'll be using google calendar to manage my calendar.  I still need to be able to see the private OmniTI calendars, so I'm still using Thunderbird/Lightning to do that.   </p>
