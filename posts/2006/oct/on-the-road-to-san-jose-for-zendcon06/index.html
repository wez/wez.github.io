<p>I'm currently sitting in Atlanta airport (because it's on the way to San Jose from BWI, obviously).   </p>
<p>I really enjoyed last years conference, so I have great expectations this year.  I'll be giving the short version of my PDO talk again this year (but this time, in shiny Keynote on my shiny macbook).   </p>
<p>I think I'll try to attend the session &quot;Managing PHP and PHP Applications on Windows&quot; to see what the folks at Microsoft have to say about that, and &quot;Unlocking The Enterprise Using PHP and Messaging and Queuing&quot; to see what IBM have planned there.  Outside of the sessions, I'm going to sit down with Andrei and Sara to discuss implementing Unicode for PDO in PHP 6.   </p>
<p>Ah, time to board.  See you there if you're there!   </p>
